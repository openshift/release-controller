// ReleasePayload encapsulates the information for the creation of a ReleasePayload
// and aggregates the results of its respective verification tests.
//
// The release-controller is configured to monitor imagestreams, in a specific namespace, that are annotated with a
// ReleaseConfig.  The ReleaseConfig is a definition of how releases are calculated.  When a ReleasePayload is
// generated, it will be generated in the same namespace as the imagstream that produced it. If/when an update
// occurs, to one of these imagestreams, the release-controller will:
//  1. Create a point-in-time mirror of the updated imagestream
//  2. Create a new Release from the mirror
//     - Any errors before this point will cause the release to marked `Failed`
//  3. Launches a set of release analysis jobs
//  4. Launches an aggregation job
//  5. Launches a set of release verification jobs
//     - These can either be `Blocking Jobs` which will prevent release acceptance or `Informing Jobs` which will
//     not prevent release acceptance.
//  6. For Stable releases, launches a set of jobs to test a subset of the supported upgrades defined inside the release
//     image itself.  While these jobs do not have any real bearing on the acceptance or rejection of a ReleasePayload,
//     they will be monitored and their respective results captured.  The hope would be to use these results to
//     provide a convenient way to override a "Rejected" release caused by a blocking upgrade job.
//  7. Monitors for job completions
//     - If all `Blocking Jobs` complete successfully, then the release is `Accepted`.  If any `Blocking Jobs` fail,
//     the release will be marked `Rejected`
//  8. Publishes all results to the respective webpage
//
// Example:
// ART:
//  1. Publishes an update to the `ocp/4.9-art-latest` imagestream
//
// Release-controller:
//  1. Creates a mirror named: `ocp/4.9-art-latest-2021-09-27-105859`
//  2. Creates a ReleasePayload: `ocp/4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859`
//     -Labels:
//     release.openshift.io/imagestream=release
//     release.openshift.io/imagestreamtag-name=4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859
//  3. Creates an OpenShift Release: `ocp/release:4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859`
//  4. Update ReleasePayload conditions with results of release creation job
//     If the release was created successfully, the release-controller:
//  5. Launches: 4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859-aggregated-<name>-analysis-<count>
//  6. Launches: 4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859-aggregated-<name>-aggregator
//  7. Launches: 4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859-<name>
//
// When ART promotes a GA release, they will assemble releases themselves, publish it to quay.io, and then update
// the "stable" release stream (i.e. ocp/release) with the corresponding payload.  In this scenario, the
// release-controller will perform all the same steps, mentioned above, but the mirror will be named after
// the "official" release (i.e. 4.9.7) and not not contain a timestamp.  Likewise, any verification tests will
// only contain the release name and the name of the verification test as defined in the ReleaseConfig.  The
// release-controller will also launch a small sample of jobs to test upgrades from the list of upgrade versions
// defined inside the release image itself:
//
// For example:
// $ oc adm release info quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.11.22-x86_64
//
// The list of supported upgrades is:
// 4.10.16, 4.10.17, 4.10.18, 4.10.20, 4.10.21, 4.10.22, 4.10.23, 4.10.24, 4.10.25, 4.10.26, 4.10.27, 4.10.28, 4.10.29,
// 4.10.30, 4.10.31, 4.10.32, 4.10.33, 4.10.34, 4.10.35, 4.10.36, 4.10.37, 4.10.38, 4.10.39, 4.10.40, 4.10.41, 4.10.42,
// 4.10.43, 4.10.44, 4.10.45, 4.10.46, 4.10.47, 4.11.0, 4.11.1, 4.11.2, 4.11.3, 4.11.4, 4.11.5, 4.11.6, 4.11.7, 4.11.8,
// 4.11.9, 4.11.10, 4.11.11, 4.11.12, 4.11.13, 4.11.14, 4.11.16, 4.11.17, 4.11.18, 4.11.19, 4.11.20, 4.11.21
//
// From the list above, the release-controller will launch a subset of jobs named like:
// 4.11.22-upgrade-from-4.10.16-<platform>
// 4.11.22-upgrade-from-4.11.0-<platform>
//
// Where <platform> is defined in the Release Configuration definitions in the openshift/release repo:
// https://github.com/openshift/release/blob/e5c9122144c09c4095f0f87888b9685712dc7b1e/core-services/release-controller/_releases/release-ocp-4.y-stable.json#L20-L30
//
// Mapping from a Release to ReleasePayload:
// A ReleasePayload will always be named after the Release that it corresponds to, with the addition of a
// random string suffix.  Both objects will reside in the same namespace.
//
//	For a release: `ocp/release:4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859`
//	A corresponding ReleasePayload will exist: `ocp/4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859`
//
// Mapping from ReleasePayload to Release:
// A ReleasePayload is decorated with a couple labels that will point back to the Release that it corresponds to:
//   - release.openshift.io/imagestream=release
//   - release.openshift.io/imagestreamtag-name=4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859
//
// Because the ReleasePayload and the Release will both reside in the same namespace, the release that created the
// ReleasePayload will be located here:
//
//	<namespace>/<release.openshift.io/imagestream>:<release.openshift.io/imagestreamtag-name>
//
// Similarly, the ReleasePayload object itself also has the PayloadCoordinates (.spec.payloadCoordinates) that point
// back to the Release as well:
//
//	spec:
//	  payloadCoordinates:
//	    imagestreamName: release
//	    imagestreamTagName: 4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859
//	    namespace: ocp
//
// The release that created the ReleasePayload will be located here:
//
//	<namespace>/<imagestreamName>:<imagestreamTagName>
//
// Compatibility level 4: No compatibility is provided, the API can change at any point for any reason. These capabilities should not be used by applications needing long term support.
